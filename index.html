<p>Ten years ago, during my spring semester at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky, I stopped believing in God.

<h3>Ethics and morality</h3>
<p>is there a difference between ethics and morality?</p>
<p>there's a discussion of this in the entry on modern morality and ancient ethics in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy.</p>
<p>the greek <em>ēthikós</em> was the adjectival form of <em>êthos</em>, "character; custom".</p>
<p>the roman politician and philosopher cicero translated this as <em>moralis</em>, the adjectival form of latin <em>mos</em>, "custom."</p>
<p>the greek word was later borrowed into latin more directly as <em>ethica</em>, and then both terms came into english through old french.</p>
<p>according to the entry, different philosophers have distinguished between these terms in various ways.</p>
<p>i suspect that the important difference in usage is that <em>ethics</em> is used more in academic and professional contexts while <em>morality</em> is more common.</p>
<p>because of that, it seems like <em>ethics</em> is more associated with theory while <em>morality</em> is more associated with the subject of ethical theory (what the entry describes as the standard position).</p>
<p>it notes that peter singer treats the views synonymously.</p>
<p>as for me, i'm going to follow peter singer's approach and treat the terms synonymously.</p>
<p>i think that finer-grained distinctions, between theory and subject or between character and custom and so on, can be made in the situations where they are important, rather than trying to load them into the modern words <em>ethics</em> and <em>morality</em>.</p>
<p>in general, i think that debates about the "correct" meanings of closely related terms are often a fruitless distraction.</p>
<h3>Epistemology</h3>
<p>
    Epistemology is the study of knowledge.
    The classic view in philosophy is that knowledge is justified true belief.
    Philosophers disagree on when beliefs are justified and on what other essential properties knowledge has.
    [On Gettier cases.]
</p>
<p>
    So long as it continues to reject empirical methods, philosophy is not equipped to answer its own questions about knowledge.
    Even if philosophers reached a consensus on a precise and elegant analysis of knowledge, it would not follow that this represents anything in the world.
    But how would you test a theory of knowledge?
    Assuming the classical analysis, you would have to test whether a belief is true and whether it is justified.
    But to test this, you would have to already know when a belief is true and when it is justified, and that's just the question being asked.
    You could at least get a start by starting with our most confident cases of knowledge, namely in math and in well-supported empirical theories.
    But I suspect that the problem of making and testing a prediction will still come up.
