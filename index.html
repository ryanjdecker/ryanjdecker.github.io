<h4>ethics and morality</h4>
<p>is there a difference between ethics and morality?</p>
<p>there's a discussion of this in the entry on modern morality and ancient ethics in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy.</p>
<p>the greek <em>ethikos</em> was the adjectival form of <em>ethos</em>, "character".</p>
<p>cicero translated this as <em>moralis</em>, the adjectival form of latin <em>mores</em>, "habits and customs."</p>
<p>the greek word was later borrowed into latin more directly as <em>ethica</em>, and then both terms came into english through old french.</p>
<p>according to the entry, different philosophers have distinguished between these terms in various ways.</p>
<p>i suspect that the important difference in usage is that <em>ethics</em> is used more in academic contexts while <em>morality</em> is more common and is found in both academic and popular contexts.</p>
<p>because of that, it seems like <em>ethics</em> is more associated with theory while <em>morality</em> is more associated with the subject of ethical theory (what the entry describes as the standard position).</p>
<p>it notes that peter singer treats the views synonymously.</p>
<p>as for me, i'm going to follow peter singer's approach and treat the terms synonymously.</p>
<p>i think that finer-grained distinctions, between theory and subject or between character and custom and so on, can be made in the situations where they are important, rather than trying to load them into the modern words <em>ethics</em> and <em>morality</em>.</p>
<p>in general, i think that debates about the "correct" meanings of closely related terms are often a fruitless distraction.</p>
