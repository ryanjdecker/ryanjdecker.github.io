<h1>APOSTASIA</h1>
<div class="navbar"><p class="nav"><span class="small-heading">BY</span> RYAN J. DECKER</p></div>
</div>
<p>
    I went to some prophetic prayer meetings.
    At these meetings, we separated into small groups.
    In each group, each person took a turn going into the center of the prayer circle.
    Then others would lay their hands on them and pray.
    We asked God to give us a prophetic word for the person we were praying for.
</p>
<p>
    Someone might start out by saying that they felt God was giving them a word about a person's relative that they were having a tough relationship with.
    If there was a little bit of a reaction, the person praying might lean in, and try to identify the relation.
    When something finally struck a great enough chord, the target might burst into tears.
    I had heard about cold reading before in books and shows, and recognized that as what this was.
</p>
<p>
    Not everything about it was harmful in itself--and that is the case for mediums and other charlatans as well.
    We really did care about each other, and these prayer meetings were an opportunity to show your deepest feelings and bring your hardest struggles into the open in an environment that was safe and accepting.
    Even the simple human contact of someone laying a hand on your shoulder and speaking to you with kindness has value.

<h2>HEADING</h2>
<p>
    Purveyors of prophecy use these facts to inoculate you against skepticism.
    How can the skeptics be so cruel and heartless as to criticize what we're doing here?
    Yet how did we so easily forget that basic human kindness existed before religion and exists now outside it?
    What do the lies actually contribute?
    What are the harms?
    Sometimes, there isn't a lot of harm.
</p>
<p>
    When people ask this, they are asking us to explain the value of believing and speaking the truth.
